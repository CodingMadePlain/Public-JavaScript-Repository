# What is JavaScript
- JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape. 
- In 1997, it was handed over to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA).
- JavaScript is a versatile programming language that has evolved into one of the most popular programming languages in the world. 
- It makes websites interactive. 

**Client-Side (Browser)** 
Client-side refers to JavaScript running in your web browser. It makes websites interactive. Think animations, form validations, and dynamically updating content without reloading the page.

**Server-Side** 
Server-side means JavaScript running on a web server (using environments like Node.js). It handles behind-the-scenes tasks like database operations, user authentication, and business logic before sending the webpage to your browser.
