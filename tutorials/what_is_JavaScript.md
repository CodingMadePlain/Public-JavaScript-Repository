# What is JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language for the web.  
Originally created in 1995 for the Netscape browser, JavaScript has evolved into one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It makes websites interactive. 

**Client-Side (Browser)** 
Client-side refers to JavaScript running in your web browser. It makes websites interactive. Think animations, form validations, and dynamically updating content without reloading the page.

**Server-Side** 
Server-side means JavaScript running on a web server (using environments like Node.js). It handles behind-the-scenes tasks like database operations, user authentication, and business logic before sending the webpage to your browser.
