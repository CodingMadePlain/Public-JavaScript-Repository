# ES6 and JavaScript
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) revolutionized JavaScript by introducing features that make the language more
powerful and readable. Key changes include:

- let and const for block-scoped variables, 
- arrow functions for a more concise syntax, and 
- the class keyword for easier object-oriented programming. 
- it added native modules (import/export) for better code organization and 
- Promises for simplifying asynchronous operations. 

These updates provided developers with a more robust and modern toolset, fundamentally improving how JavaScript is written.
