# JavaScript Libraries
A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written JavaScript code that you can use to perform common tasks more easily. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use these ready-made functions and tools to save time and effort.

## Common JavaScript Libraries

**React** - A library for building user interfaces using reusable components, maintained by Meta (Facebook).

**jQuery** - Simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX requests with easy syntax, though less popular now with modern JavaScript.

**Vue.js** - A progressive framework for building UIs that's beginner-friendly and can be adopted incrementally.

**Angular** - A full-featured framework by Google for building large-scale web applications with built-in tools.

**D3.js** - Creates powerful, customizable data visualizations and interactive charts using web standards.

**Lodash** - Provides utility functions for common programming tasks like working with arrays and objects more easily.

**Axios** - Makes HTTP requests simpler and more reliable than the built-in fetch API.

**Express.js** - A minimal Node.js framework for building web servers and APIs quickly.

**Three.js** - Enables creation of 3D graphics and animations in the browser using WebGL.

**Chart.js** - Creates simple, responsive charts and graphs with minimal configuration needed.

## Dangers or over relying on JavaScript Libraries
1. Performance overhead
2. Increased Complexity
3. Dependency and Maintenance Issues
4. Security Vulnerabilities
5. Unnecessary Bloat
6. Skill Atrophy

While JavaScript libraries are powerful tools, it is important to use them judiciously. For small projects, it might be better to stick with vanilla JavaScript. For larger projects, carefully consider the trade-offs and choose libraries that are well-maintained, secure, and a good fit for your specific needs.
